# Boid Simulation
This sample project showcases the flocking algorithm which was originally presented by Craig Reynolds in his program "Boids".  
This repository also contains a powerpoint which explains flocking algorithms, its properties and its applications in nature, industry and video games.  
## How to use
1. Download the repository as a zip, extract the zip file and then open the root folder in unity hub (You may use git clone to download the enitre repository).  
2. If you are not already in main scene, open it. Select the BoidSpawner object from the hierarchy panel, then you can tweak different parameters (such as weight of different rules, view angle, custom speed and ...) from the Inspector panel.  
3. To run the simulation, simply run the main scene. You change change the movement parameters during runtime, and the boids will move according to the changes. However, the boid spawning count cannot be changed during runtime.
