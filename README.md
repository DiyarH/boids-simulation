# Boid Simulation
This sample project showcases the flocking algorithm which was originally presented by Craig Reynolds in his program "Boids".  
This repository also contains a powerpoint which explains flocking algorithms, its properties and its applications in nature, industry and video games.  
## How to use
Open the project file in unity. If you are not already in main scene, open it. Select the BoidSpawner object from the hierarchy panel, then you can change different parameters (such as weight of different rules, view angle, custom speed and ...) from the Inspector panel.  
To run the simulation, simply run the main scene. You change change the movement parameters during runtime, and the boids will move according to the changes. However, the boid spawning count cannot be changed during runtime.
